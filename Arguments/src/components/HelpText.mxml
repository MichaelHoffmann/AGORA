			<![CDATA[ <u>Support:</u> <br/><br/> Select a scheme and then a language form for this scheme. Then enter your reason and/or claim. You can change the argument scheme or the language form any time by clicking on the name of the argument scheme. <br /><br /><br /> Your input will create a <a href="http://agora.gatech.edu/?page_id=257" target="_blank"><u><i>logically(deductively) valid argument </i></u> </a>, meaning that your conclusion is necessarily true if all your premises are true. The validity of your argument is guaranteed by the fact that you can only select one of those traditional argument forms that are logically valid, and by the fact that the software automatically creates an additional premise that makes your argument valid. This additional premise is called the 'enabler' of your argument. If this automatically created enabler does not seem right to you, change the formulation of your reason and/or your claim, or the argument scheme, until the formulation fits and you can accept the truth of the enabler and all your reasons. <br /><br /><br />The AGORA system provides only logically valid argument schemes in order to motivate reflection and to facilitate the evaluation of the quality of arguments. Since every system-generated argument in AGORA is logically valid, you can see how an argument needs to look like if the goal was to guarantee the truth of the conclusion. You should use this as an opportunity to revise the components of your argument as long as it takes to formulate and structure the best possible argument. To achieve this goal it might be necessary to revise the formulation of your reason or your claim; or it might be necessary to break your argument up and to insert intermediary reasons, creating thus a chain or network of arguments instead of a single argument; or it might be necessary to qualify your conclusion with a 'probably,' 'usually,' 'under normal circumstances' or 'possibly.' You can also insert additional reasons that are necessary to justify your conclusion, or you include certain exceptions or conditions into the formulation of your conclusion. <br /><br /><br /> To make your argument as powerful, clear, and convincing as possible, try to get the structure and the formulations right, and select that argument scheme that fits best to what you want to argue.
